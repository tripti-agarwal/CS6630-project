Feedback:
I think the overall idea of your project is very clear and it will be interesting to see how trends are in your data. Once you have one of the prototypes ready, I think you will be able to show the rest of the prototype easily.
I am expecting to see 80-90% of one of the prototypes ready by the first milestone.
Also, I would like to know the use of adding a map in prototype 2 by then. Thanks :)
